## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added
- Back up a 12–24 word BIP39 seed phrase to an NFC tag, encrypted with a
  password (Argon2id + AES-256-GCM, format v1). Words are entered with the
  app's own keypad and checked against the wordlist and checksum.
- Optional generated 7-word passphrase, with a strength hint for typed passwords.
- Every write is read back and compared; a tag that already holds data is only
  overwritten after confirmation.
- Verify (✓ and a fingerprint, words stay hidden) and Restore (shows the words).
- Make the tag permanently read-only, behind a confirmation.
- No network permission, screenshots blocked, no backups; everything typed or
  decrypted is wiped when the app leaves the foreground.
- `tools/seedtag.py`: encrypt, decrypt and verify on a computer, byte-compatible
  with the app.
